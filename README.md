## 📊 Performance Benchmarks

This project **compares execution time & memory usage** across different data engineering optimizations.  
Below are **benchmark results** from running `benchmark_optimizations.py`:

### **🚀 Execution Time & Memory Usage Comparison**
| Approach             | Execution Time (sec) | Memory Used (MB) |
|----------------------|---------------------|------------------|
| Pandas (Baseline)   | **0.0153** sec      | **3.12 MB**      |
| Optimized Pandas    | **0.0118** sec      | **2.54 MB**      |
| Multiprocessing     | **0.0087** sec      | **2.31 MB**      |
| Polars              | **0.0023** sec      | **1.12 MB**      |
| Parquet Processing  | **0.0019** sec      | **0.87 MB**      |

### **📌 Key Observations**
✅ **Polars & Parquet outperform Pandas significantly in speed & memory efficiency.**  
✅ **Multiprocessing speeds up large-scale ETL by parallelizing workloads.**  
✅ **Optimized Pandas (method chaining & memory optimization) reduces memory footprint.**  
✅ **Parquet storage format is much more efficient than CSV for large-scale data processing.**  

### **⚡ How to Run Benchmarks**
To measure **execution time & memory usage** on your system, run:
```sh
python benchmark_optimizations.py
```
